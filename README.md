 + Following a tutorial for Spring and Thymeleaf to learn how to eventually build a photo Upload form, which I will be modifying for use in other on-going projects. This feature is intended for web applications with java backends. 

+ The sample User class does not contain any security authentication or encryption for the password variable yet, because this is just a template I created to learn how to implement a photo upload feature in other projects that already contain security authentication in the User classes. I am also completing this project in Java 11 with Maven so that I can compare building programs in Gradle with using Maven. 

+ My app feature is to create objects of songs grouped by mood, genre, artist, and title. (This will also be used in a more complicated web app, so I decided to start experimenting with building objects for it now.)
